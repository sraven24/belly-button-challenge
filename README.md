# belly-button-challenge
A look into the biodiversity of microbial species in human belly buttons. For this challenge, a small website was developed to display the data of a study on various samples taken from human belly buttons. A drop down menu was employed to allow a user to select one of the many samples taken.  After a selection is made, you can see the demographic information of the host sample in a panel on the left hand side.  There will also be a bar graph with the top 10 microbs present as well as a Bubble Chart showing the microbs by type and prevalance.  You can also hoover over the entries for additional information.

# Installation
The user should simply be able to access the site : https://sraven24.github.io/belly-button-challenge/.  Here you will be able to use the drop down menu to select one of the test samples to see the top 10 most prevalent microbs within that subject and a bubble chart of all microbes present within that test sample.
